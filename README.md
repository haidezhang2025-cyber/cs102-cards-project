## Project Structure: JavaFX UI and Console UI

This project includes two different user interfaces: a **JavaFX GUI** and a **console UI**.  
Although both versions implement the same game, they do not use exactly the same supporting classes.

### Shared Classes

Some classes are shared between both versions because they represent the core game data and game objects. These include:

- `AbstractCard`
- `Player`
- `Token`, `TokenBank`
- `DevelopmentCard`, `DevelopmentCardDeck`, `DevelopmentCardFaceUP`
- `Noble`, `NobleDeck`, `NobleFaceUP`
- most classes under the `Cards/` package
- `PurchaseService`

These shared classes store the game state and data structures needed regardless of whether the game is played through the JavaFX GUI or the console UI.

### Different Classes Used by Each UI

Some important classes differ between the two versions.

#### JavaFX version
The JavaFX version uses:
- `GameLogic` to manage turn flow, actions, noble selection, and win-condition logic
- `MoveResult` to report whether an action succeeded and what message should be shown in the GUI
- `NobleService` to handle noble eligibility and awarding
- `ComputerService` to control the computer player's decisions

#### Console version
The console UI does not use those same classes in the same way:
- game flow is handled directly inside `Game.java` instead of through `GameLogic`
- `MoveResult` is not used, since it is mainly designed for JavaFX controller feedback
- `NobleAttractService` is used instead of `NobleService`
- the `Computer` class is used directly instead of `ComputerService`

### Rough Equivalents Between the Two Versions

| Console UI | JavaFX UI |
|------------|-----------|
| `Game.java` | `GameLogic.java` |
| `NobleAttractService` | `NobleService` |
| `Computer` | `ComputerService` |

These are not exact replacements, but they serve similar roles in each version.

### JavaFX-Specific Classes

The JavaFX-specific classes are responsible for the graphical interface. These include:

- `GameApp`
- `MenuController`
- `Controller`
- `BoardView`
- `CardView`

These classes handle buttons, mouse clicks, popups, animations, and the visual display of the board. They depend on JavaFX-specific functionality and are not used by the console version.

### Console-Specific Classes

The console-specific classes are responsible for text-based input and output. They display prompts, read terminal input, and guide the player through the game using printed text instead of graphical components.

### Summary

The two interfaces share the same core game data classes, but differ in their controller and interaction logic.  
This design allows both versions to represent the same game while using different implementations suited to their respective interfaces.
