    // the name is a constant but value is a varible, so that variable is mapped to a constant, so whenever i want to change

    // However, the development card has no variables which needs to be changed manually, so there is not need to search for a 
    // specific card. System can just randomly draw cards from the deck and place it on the table and for player to buy it.
